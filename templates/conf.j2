### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.

### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is

  # actually released data written into a tsm1 engine may be need to be wiped
  # between upgrades.

### [hinted-handoff]

###
### [shard-precreation]
###
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are created before data arrives.
### Only shards that will exist in the future, at time of creation, are precreated.

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.
